\section {Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

The methodology of \cite{hall-jurafsky-manning:2008:EMNLP} worked! It provided a means to prove and disprove some of the proposed hypotheses as well as cast more light on the data. By combining the output Gibbs sampling and metrics such as \textit{topic entropy} and \textit{Jensen-Shannon divergence}, various subsets of the dataset could be compared and cotrasted robustly and easily.

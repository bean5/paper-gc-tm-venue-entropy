\section {Future Work}
%\textbf{}
This work can be used for future work in several ways. Following are some examples 
	\begin {itemize}
		\item Use some method to locate pairs of nearest neighbor documents, perhaps using a method similar to that used in \cite{Krstovski2013efficient}
%		\item [Insert more here]
	\end {itemize}
The possibilities for future work is apparent. 

Future work need not focus on only one of the above at a time.  Studies could perform two or more of the above if desired.

\section {Future Work}
The possibilities for future work is apparent. Besides the future work mentioned already, following are some examples:
	\begin {itemize}
		\item Use topical n-grams and compare to unigram models such as the ones used here.
		\item Use some method to locate pairs of nearest neighbor documents, perhaps using a method similar to that used in \cite{Krstovski2013efficient}
	\end {itemize}

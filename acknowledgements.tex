A big thank-you is in order for Dr. Ringger for having taught me what I was lacking for this project. I thank my wife for being my best friend. She has proven to be true help-meet for me, especially when times get tough, such as when your database gets corrupted or locks up or when you think you are a victim of an amazing virus and is willing to help you change all your passwords at a moment's notice.
